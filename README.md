# cs490
A CS capstone project designed to facilitate the creation, taking, evaluation and grading of mock Intro to CS programming exams. Made for NJIT's CS490 course as a semester-long project.


Notes:
- Files are uploaded here for version history / keeping track of changes, but these pages are written with the assumption that they are to be hosted on webpages on NJIT servers.
- Despite existing as a shared repository, each team member is required to code their portion (front-end/middle-end/back-end) separately.
